# Few words on graph traversal
## Graph traversal means visiting every vertex and edges of a graph in a well defined order. The order in which the vertices are traversed depends up on the algorithm we use for the specific task.

## There are two popular ways for traversing through a graph 
## BFS(Breadth first search) and DFS(depth first search)


# BFS
## Breadth
